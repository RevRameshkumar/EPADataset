Abstract:

We describe the Enron People Assignment
(EPA) dataset, in which tasks that are
described in emails are associated with the
person(s) responsible for carrying out these
tasks. We identify tasks and the responsible
people in the Enron email dataset. We
define evaluation methods for this
challenge and report scores for our model
and na√Øve baselines. The resulting model
enables a user experience operating within
a commercial email service: given a person
and a task, it determines if the person
should be notified of the task.
